# Kruskal's algorithm

## Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) implementation in C/C++

This project is part of a Graph Theory course assignment. It utilizes C/C++ code to implement Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of four provided graphs.

The code takes input graphs in a specified format and outputs the corresponding minimum spanning tree to a file, using the same format as the input graph. The input file format consists of the number of vertices in the graph on the first line, followed by lines representing edges in the format *x y p*, where *x* and *y* denote the vertices connected by an edge, and *p* represents the weight of that edge.

This repository contains the provided graphs along with the project deliverables, including:

* Well-commented implementation code;
* Output files;
* PDF document formatted like an academic article, detailing the implemented algorithms, the rationale behind implementation decisions, and the obtained results. This includes the weights of the minimum spanning trees for each of the graph instances.
